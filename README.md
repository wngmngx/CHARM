This folder project contains two folders, and I will describe their respective uses below.

## CHARM_preprocess_pipeline

The CHARM_preprocess_pipeline contains a snakemake pipeline for pre-processing CHARM data.

### Usage
1. Place the Rawdata folder and the CHARM_preprocess_pipeline folder in the same directory.
```bash
tree -h -L 2
# .
# ├── [ 252]  CHARM_preprocess_pipeline
# │   ├── [3.0K]  config.yaml
# │   ├── [  35]  envs
# │   ├── [ 248]  CHARM_scripts
# │   ├── [3.1K]  CHARM.smk
# │   ├── [ 224]  rules
# │   ├── [ 361]  runCHARM.sh
# │   └── [ 20K]  stat.ipynb
# |   ...
# └── [  33]  Rawdata
#     └── [  40]  R1P10013 -> ../../CHARM_test/Rawdata/R1P10013
```
You can use the sampled data along with this repo(R1P10013small) for testing, but full data is recommand since structure reconsturction require much more Hi-C contacts. 

2. Installation of environment

Should take less than 1h to install the environment, depends on your internet speed.

```bash
mamba create -n charm -c conda-forge -c bioconda python=3.8 snakemake=5.20.1 
mamba activate charm
mamba env update --file CHARM_preprocess_pipeline/envs/charm.yaml
```
3. Prepare files

CHARM_preprocess_pipeline relies on a modified version of hickit (original link: https://github.com/lh3/hickit/ , but no need to download it) and CHARMtools(https://github.com/skelviper/CHARMtools) in addition to softwares that can be installed automatically. Also you need to build index for RNA/DNA seperately on your version of reference genome.

```bash
cd CHARM_preprocess_pipeline
vim config.yaml
```

4. Run the pipeline
```bash
cd CHARM_preprocess_pipeline; ./runCHARM.sh
```

5. generate statistics

    see analysis/stat.ipynb

## analysis_and_plot_notebooks

analysis_and_plot_notebooks holds the python/R notebooks used in the analysis of the project.
